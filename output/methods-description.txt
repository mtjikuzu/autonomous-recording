Master Java methods in one video — void methods, parameters, return types, overloading, and recursion. We build, compile, and run a complete MethodsDemo.java program in VS Code from scratch.

Methods are the single most important building block in Java (and every other language). This tutorial walks you through five core concepts in one session: writing a void method, adding parameters, returning values, method overloading, and recursive methods — all in a single runnable Java file.

📌 What you will learn:
• Void methods — performing an action without returning anything
• Parameters — making methods flexible and reusable
• Return types — int, double, and when to use them
• Method overloading — same name, different parameters (Java picks the right one)
• Recursion — a method that calls itself, with a base case to stop it
• Compiling and running multi-method Java programs from the terminal

⏱ Chapters:
0:00 Introduction — why methods matter in every language
0:38 Opening the file in VS Code
1:00 Writing a void method: greet()
1:52 Adding parameters: greetUser(String name)
2:45 Return types: add(int a, int b)
3:40 Method overloading: add(double a, double b)
4:38 Recursion: factorial(int n) with base case
5:45 Writing the main method and calling everything
7:10 Compiling with javac and running the program
8:10 Recap and what to learn next

💻 Key concepts from the code:
• void greet()          — no input, no return, just runs
• void greetUser(String name) — takes a String parameter
• int add(int a, int b)       — returns an int
• double add(double a, double b) — overloaded version
• int factorial(int n)        — recursive, calls itself until n <= 1

📚 Great for:
• Java beginners learning functions and methods
• Students studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
• Anyone who wants to understand recursion with a clear example
• Coding interview prep — method design is tested constantly
