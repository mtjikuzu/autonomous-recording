Learn Bubble Sort in Java from scratch — we write, compile, and run the full algorithm in VS Code in under 7 minutes. If you can shuffle a deck of cards, you already understand the core idea.

In this tutorial you will write a complete BubbleSort.java program step by step, covering nested loops, the classic temp-variable swap pattern, and how to compile and run Java from the integrated terminal. By the end you will have a working sorter and a clear mental model of O(n²) time complexity.

📌 What you will learn:
• How bubble sort works (the card-shuffle analogy)
• Writing nested loops to make passes through an array
• The temp-variable swap pattern — used in algorithms everywhere
• Compiling with javac and running with java in VS Code's terminal
• Why bubble sort is O(n²) and when to use it vs faster alternatives

💻 Source code:
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                }
    }
}
